# sunlight (private)

A quiet tool to bring clear light to local government in Knoxville—so that families, small businesses, neighborhoods, and the whole city can make better decisions and flourish together.

Knoxville is the first living prototype. The pattern will spread.

## The intuition
When relationships, money, appointments, and salaries are gently made visible, trust grows naturally.  
People self-correct.  
Communities coordinate.  
Good ideas win without force.

There is no enemy here—only shadows that dissolve in ordinary daylight.

## The only four public data sources we need
1. Government contracts & bid awards  
2. Campaign contribution reports  
3. Board/commission appointments + meeting minutes  
4. Organizational charts + public salary database  

Connected simply, these four create a shared map that any resident or business owner can read in seconds.

## Current status
Private workshop.  
Building slowly and carefully until the light is clean, kind, and undeniably useful.

When it’s ready, we’ll open the window and let the sun in.

No drama.  
Just daylight.
