# sunlight (private)

The corruption-killing graph engine.  
Knoxville is the prototype → every other city follows.

Corruption and nepotism die in sunlight.  
This repo builds the torch strong enough to make the shadows impossible.

## First-principles mission
Make it physically impossible for a Knox County / Knoxville official, relative, donor, or crony to extract money or power without every citizen seeing the exact connection in <10 seconds.

We do that with four (and only four) public data sources connected into one queryable graph.

## The only four sources that matter (v1)
1. Government contracts & bid awards (money flow)
2. Campaign finance disclosures (influence flow)
3. Board/commission appointments + meeting minutes (power flow)
4. Org charts + public employee salary database (extraction flow)

Everything else is noise until these four are live and lighting up clusters.

## Current status
→ Private for now. Building in the dark until the tool is bullet-proof and outputs are anonymized by default.

No rush. No leaks. No half-baked screenshots.

Sunlight is coming.  
We’re just sharpening the blade first.
