# Knox Sunlight

A quiet, automated tool that turns publicly available government data into a single, living network graph of money and influence in Knoxville & Knox County.

Daylight on relationships and flows helps everyone — residents, journalists, officials, and researchers — understand how decisions are made. No accusations, no editorials, just connected facts.

The pattern is intentionally simple so any city can copy it in a weekend.

**Raw data repository** → https://github.com/Chad-Mitchell/knox-sunlight-data  
First automated update target: January 2026

## What we show (all from official public sources)

| Dataset                            | Source                                      | Update cadence | Purpose                              |
|------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------|--------------------------------------|
| Tax-increment financing (TIF) & payment-in-lieu-of-taxes (PILOT) projects | City of Knoxville / Knox County records     | Quarterly → Weekly | Show which entities receive incentives |
| Campaign contributions (≥ $1,000)  | Tennessee Registry of Election Finance      | Quarterly      | Document disclosed political donations |
| City Council & County Commission voting records | iQM2 agendas & minutes                      | Weekly         | Record who sponsored and supported each item |
| Major contracts & bid awards       | City Purchasing / KnoxBuys                | Monthly        | Track public spending flows (phase 2) |

These four datasets, linked together, are sufficient for meaningful daylight.

## Philosophy

> “When ordinary daylight falls on relationships, money, appointments, and salaries, trust grows, communities coordinate, and people flourish — without anyone having to fight.”

No commentary is added. The graph speaks for itself.
