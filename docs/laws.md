# Tennessee Laws That Create the Graph Edges

Every large flow you will ever see in the Knoxville sunlight graph is legally enabled by one of these statutes.  
They are public law — not opinion.

| Statute                                | Common name                            | What it legally permits                                      | Typical edge pattern in the graph                              |

These are the physics engine.  
When a cluster lights up, the statute is almost always one of the five above.
